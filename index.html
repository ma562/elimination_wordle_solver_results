				From the previous example, we might end up with the following possible answers:<br><br>
				<li>maker, taker, baker, faker, mater, poker</li><br>

				The program will determine the letters of interest as m, a, k, t, o, b, f, p. Notice that the program often prioritizes and chooses words that contain the first few letters. If it is unable to match it all, it will continue to look for words with letters down the list. How it chooses the letters is it iterates through each column and finds the most frequently appearing letter. In this case m is the most frequent in column 1, a in column 2, k in column 3. Column 4 and 5 are skipped because there is no uncertainty among those columns. Again it goes through column 1 and finds t, column 2 and finds o. Column 3 is finished since we already found t. The program continues to do this until there are no more letters of interest.<br><br>
